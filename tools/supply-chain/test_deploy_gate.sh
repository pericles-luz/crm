# Regression test for the cosign verify gate in deploy/scripts/stg-deploy.sh.
# ADR 0084 §Verification item 1 (SIN-62247).
#
# Strategy: build a sandbox /opt/crm/stg layout, point the script at it, and
# put fake `cosign` and `docker` on PATH. Assert:
#   - deploy succeeds when cosign verify returns 0;
#   - deploy aborts (non-zero exit, compose NEVER invoked) when cosign verify
#     returns non-zero (= unsigned or invalid signature);
#   - the script refuses an image ref that does not match the digest regex;
#   - the script refuses to start when cosign is missing from PATH.
#
# No real registry, no real cosign, no real docker is required. Run with:
#   bash tools/supply-chain/test_deploy_gate.sh

# patch the readonly STG_DIR on the fly via a `bash -c` wrapper.
#
# NB: we cannot just set readonly variables before sourcing — the script
# re-declares them. So we use a small wrapper that rewrites the absolute
# paths to point at our sandbox.
