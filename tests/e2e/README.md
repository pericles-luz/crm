# tests/e2e — browser smoke

Playwright suite that drives the production renderers
(`internal/http/handler/aipanel`) + rate-limit middleware
(`internal/http/middleware/ratelimit`) end-to-end through a real browser.
Adds the AI panel cooldown UI smoke for SIN-62318.

## What runs here

- `cmd/aipanel-e2e-fixture` — a Go HTTP fixture binary (NOT a production
  surface) that mounts the live regenerate button, the cooldown swap, and
  an in-memory token-bucket limiter so the spam-click flow is
  deterministic in a few seconds.
- `tests/e2e/specs/aipanel-cooldown.spec.ts` — covers the four
  acceptance criteria from SIN-62318:
  1. spam-click → 429 → outerHTML swap → bar shrinks → recovery
  2. `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` collapses the bar without animation
  3. keyboard focus + native disabled semantics survive the swap
  4. CLS during the swap stays under the 0.05 "Good" threshold

The Go fixture is unit-tested in `cmd/aipanel-e2e-fixture/main_test.go`
and runs in the standard `go test ./...` suite.

## One-time setup

The repo does not vendor Playwright or its browser bundle (~300 MB).
Each developer / CI runner installs them locally:

```bash
cd tests/e2e
npm install
npx playwright install chromium --with-deps
```

`--with-deps` pulls system libraries on Linux. Skip it on macOS/WSL.

## Running the suite

```bash
# from repo root — build the Go fixture, then run Playwright
cd tests/e2e
npm run fixture:build
npm test
```

`npm test` starts the fixture as Playwright's `webServer` on
`127.0.0.1:8088`, runs the spec, and shuts the fixture down. Set
`CI=1` to enable retries + the GitHub reporter.

### Useful overrides

- `AIPANEL_FIXTURE_PORT` — port the fixture binds to (default `8088`).
- `AIPANEL_COOLDOWN_MS` — token-bucket refill interval the test waits on
  (default `1500` ms). Lower for faster runs; raise if a busy laptop
  flakes the bar-width assertion.

### Headed / debugging

```bash
npm run test:headed                 # watch the browser drive the swap
npx playwright test --ui            # interactive UI mode
npx playwright test --debug         # step through with Playwright Inspector
npm run test:report                 # open HTML report after a run
```

## CI

Not yet wired into `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. The Go fixture's unit
tests (`./cmd/aipanel-e2e-fixture/...`) run as part of the standard
`go test ./...` job and gate the swap-target / wiring invariants. The
browser layer is opt-in until the runner image picks up Playwright;
follow-up issue tracks that.

## Why a fixture and not the real `cmd/server`

The production server isn't yet wired with the AI panel route — that
landed at the renderer level in SIN-62317 and is mounted by whichever
tenant route owns the panel. The fixture wires the renderers + the
production middleware in the smallest possible harness so the browser
flow can be tested independently of the larger panel-host route. When
the production route lands, this suite can be repointed at it (or kept
as the smoke harness for the renderer in isolation).
