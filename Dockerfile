# CRM container image — Fase 0 PR9 (SIN-62215).
#
# Multi-stage build: a Go builder produces a statically linked binary, then we
# copy it into a distroless runtime that has no shell and no package manager.
# Image is pushed to ghcr.io/pericles-luz/crm:<git-sha> by .github/workflows/cd-stg.yml
# and consumed by deploy/compose/compose.stg.yml via APP_IMAGE=...@sha256:<digest>.
#
# Pin policy (CEO follow-up SIN-62208 / AC #6 of SIN-62215): builder and runtime
# are pinned by SHA256 digest. Bumping the digests is documented in
# docs/deploy/staging.md ("Bumping infra image digests"). Tag is kept alongside
# the digest so a human reading the file sees the version, but Docker resolves
# strictly by digest.
