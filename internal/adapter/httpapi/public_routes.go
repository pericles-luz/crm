// Package httpapi public_routes — declarative allowlist of routes that
// MAY be reached without RequireAuth. Anything not in this list is
// expected to chain RequireAuth + RequireAction.
//
// The list is the single source of truth consumed by:
//
//  1. The router wireup (regression test asserts every public route
//     handler is mounted without middleware.Auth — to prove the spec
//     and the wireup agree).
//  2. The cmd/authzlint analyzer (PR-B, [SIN-62728]§4 follow-up) —
//     it parses chi route registrations and fails when a route is
//     neither in this list nor wrapped in RequireAuth + RequireAction.
//
// Patterns are stored as (Method, Pattern) tuples. Pattern strings
// follow chi's path-template syntax (no leading host, no query). Each
// row carries a Reason so the audit trail and the lint diagnostic can
// quote a load-bearing justification.
//
// Adding a new entry requires a comment in the issue thread (or an
// ADR delta) — declarative-allowlist drift is exactly the regression
// the lint exists to catch.
